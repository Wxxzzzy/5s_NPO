When you feel you're alone
Cut off from this cruel world
Your instinct's telling you to run
Listen to your heart, those angel voices
They'll sing to you
They'll be your guide back home
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind,
It keeps us kind.

When you suffered it all
And your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember your love
And you always will be
This melody will always bring
You right back home
When life leaves us blind
Love, keeps us kind
